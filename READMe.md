The HTML code defines a simple gallery with three images. The CSS code styles the gallery by displaying the images in a flex container and applying some basic styling. The JavaScript code adds a click event listener to each image and logs a message to the console when an image is clicked.

Remember to replace the image sources (e.g., "image1.jpg", "image2.jpg", "image3.jpg") with the actual paths to your own images.

Feel free to customize the code further based on your requirements!
